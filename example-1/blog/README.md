# Example 1

When you start a Django project you'll usually add some new models. This example is the simplest,
happiest path.

Here we've got two new models and no migrations yet. Run `./manage.py makemigrations` and
`./manage.py migrate` to add the models to the database (and see the changes in `db.sqlite3`).
